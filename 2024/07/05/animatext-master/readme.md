## This is the third step to my animation template

- It is the follow up to this: https://github.com/AlexRz912/dynamic_letter_code_kata_v2
- I'm looking for feedback, if you wish to do a code review, be my guest, I need to learn on performance optimisation and clean architecture.
- It's also a code kata i've created, instructions below.

## Code kata Instruction

- Display letters one by one on the screen, with random characters appearing briefly before the actual characters of the text. It's an animation often seen in movies and can be easily done using After Effects, but this time, without using a video format.

- Optional: Generate multiple texts dynamically, regardless of the number of texts. After generating each text, wait approximately 1 second to allow for reading before deleting the text and generating the next one.

- Clone the repository and launch a server to see what happens in index.html

## Fun fact

I needed some filler words to illustrate the use of the animation.
A friend of mine known as "Jeep" just started learning the piano, so I had some fun and asked ChatGPT to write a poem about his poor piano skills, with a theme of "rolling over the piano." Jeep loved the poem!

## why is it public

I'm now trying to put "Learn In Public" in practice, which I've heard for the first time on codewars :

The only thoughts I have given to this animation template: make it work with architecture as clean as I can.
