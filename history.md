# History

This is the story of the first Coding Dojo in the world.

## Before the dojo

### Wiki

In <time datetime="1995-03-25">1995</time>,
[Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) invented the wiki.

#### Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc.

The first wiki was used by [Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc.](https://c2.com/).

Some people discussed Object-Oriented Programming and Agile together and got to know each other through this wiki.

### Kata ü•ã

In <time datetime="2003-03-25">2003</time>,
[Dave Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_%28programmer%29) posted [an article](https://web.archive.org/web/20040423023001/http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/CodeKata.rdoc)
in which he described the Code [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata#Outside_martial_arts) :
how to master development techniques by practising programming exercises.

### Dojo üèØ

In <time datetime="2004-05-21">2004</time>,
[Laurent Bossavit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Bossavit) posted [the following text](https://web.archive.org/web/20040605124346/http://bossavit.com/thoughts/) :

> Object dojo
>
> If I want to learn Judo, I will enroll at the nearest dojo, and show up for one hour every week for the next two years, at the end of which I may opt for a more assiduous course of study to progress in the art. Years of further training might be rewarded with a black belt, which is merely the sign of ascent to a different stage of learning. No master ever stops learning.
>
> If I want to learn object programming, my employer will pack me off to a three-day Java course picked from this year's issue of a big training firm's catalog.
>
> What's wrong with this picture ?
>
> Dave Thomas has got the right idea with his [Kata](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607052051/http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata), but it needs to be taken further. What I want is an object dojo.

## Shaping the dojo

During a meal between Laurent Bossavit and [Emmanuel Gaillot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Gaillot) :

* Emmanuel asked Laurent <q>About this dojo stuff, were you joking ?</q>
* Laurent answered <q>No, I was being quite serious.</q>
* Emmanuel replied <q>I think it's great, let's do it !</q>

On [<time datetime="2004-11-02">2004-11-02</time>](https://web.archive.org/web/20081118080350/http://xp-france.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement/DeuxNovembre2004),
there was an initial discussion
about the shape of the dojo
with several people.

During this discussion,
it was decided that the dojo would not be owned by a company.

The dojo will need logistical support (room, projector, chairs ‚Ä¶),
and [Epiconcept](https://www.epiconcept.fr/en/) was the first to provide it.

## The beginnings

On [<time datetime="2004-12-13">2004-12-13</time>](https://web.archive.org/web/20081118133051/http://xp-france.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement/DojoZero),
the first dojo took place,
the participants practised in groups of two.

On [<time datetime="2005-01-10">2005-01-10</time>](https://web.archive.org/web/20050110063104/http://xp-france.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement),
like all the following dojos,
the second dojo began with a retro,
the first dojo was horrible according to everyone,
they decided to practice together in a united group.

Since 2004, a new dojo has been held almost every week.

## Archives

The group archived its work on [the xp-france.net wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20091209141145/http://xp-france.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement),
which has since disappeared ;
they moved to [the agile-france.org wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20100424015604/http://wiki.agile-france.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement).

## Break

The group took a break around 2014 and was relaunched by [ToF](https://christophethibaut.com) in 2015.

They started archiving their sessions in a git repository hosted on [Github](https://github.com/dojo-developpement-paris/dojo-developpement-paris.github.io),
since the session of [<time datetime="2015-01-15">2015-01-15</time>](https://github.com/dojo-developpement-paris/dojo-developpement-paris.github.io/tree/main/2015/01/05).

They started using [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/dojo-developpement-paris/),
since the session of [<time datetime="2015-01-19">2015-01-19</time>](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/dojo-developpement-paris/events/219806503/).

## Lockdown

The last dojo before the lockdown was [<time datetime="2020-03-12">2020-03-12</time>](https://www.meetup.com/dojo-developpement-paris/events/269323464/).

The lockdown paused the dojo.

There was an attempt to resume online
from [<time datetime="2021-01-28">2021-01-28</time>](https://www.meetup.com/dojo-developpement-paris/events/275980672/) to [<time datetime="2021-06-17">2021-06-17</time>](https://www.meetup.com/dojo-developpement-paris/events/278752692/).

The dojo has been back in person since [<time datetime="2022-05-13">2022-05-13</time>](https://www.meetup.com/dojo-developpement-paris/events/285807516/).

## Trends

The dojo has been hosted by a number of companies, including :

* EpiConcept
* UT7
* Octo
* Zenika
* Arolla
* CodeWorks
* Enercoop

A wide range of languages were practised at the dojo,
with many sessions taking place in :

* Ruby
* Haskell

## Legacy

Since :

* the term [Dojo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo#Computer-related) is commonly used by the developer community without knowing this story
* [there are many Coding Dojos around the world](https://codingdojo.org/practices/CodingDojos/)
* [the group](https://www.meetup.com/dojo-developpement-paris/) (at the time of writing) has over 1600+ members
