Retro: Kata Haskell Word Ladder
- It was not done completely
- We spent a lot of explaining Haskell syntax and so on
- Lots of new people
- 90 minutes might be a bit short for this kata
- I was confused and created a Dictionary structure for nothing
- (I was suggested to use id instead of it, but was not listening)
- There was no written description of how we were going to solve the problem

Sujets proposés :
A - Haskell - Mob - Exploration of simple concepts like pattern matching with the bonus/malus kata
B - Haskell - Mob - Word Ladder 
C - Haskell - Mob - Balance expenses -- e.g. netting a bill at a bar
